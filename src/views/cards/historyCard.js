                    The idea for the hall was conceived in 1944 and following the numerous restrictions in money and materials at that time, the foundation stone was laid in June 1955.
                    The building work was undertaken using both contract and considerable voluntary labour with the building being officially opened in June 1957. Various extensions followed with the hall being in its present form since 1976.

                    Solar panels were recently added and the car park has been re-surfaced. The Hall also has a stage with spot and stage lighting, PA system and a theatre seating license of 265.
                    Hall capacity is 360. The Hall has a Loop Hearing System and Disabled Toilets.
